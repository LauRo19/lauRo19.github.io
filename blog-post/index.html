<h1>WHEN CAN ANIMATIONS HURT USER EXPERIENCE?</h1>
<img src="images/GIF-UI-Design-003.gif">
<p style="font family:Archer">
  The decision to use animation should be 
  treated as any other design decision;
  you have to weigh the pros and cons 
  and make sure that the user experience
  is not compromised, and that you won’t 
  be stuck with a lot of inefficient code
  (which you may have to tweak and update
  later on). Generally, using animation 
  for the sake of animation is not a good
  idea. Web animation technology has 
  matured, but the fact that it’s widely 
  available shouldn’t be the only reason 
  behind your decision to implement it.
</p>
<p>
  As pleasant as motion and animations are,
  there are some downsides to consider. 
  While browser support is better than ever, 
  it is still early in the implementation 
  and (as always) not all browsers handle 
  the code the same way. If the user has an 
  outdated browser or bad connection, the 
  animation can be jumpy or not work at all, 
  which results in a bad experience. 
</p>
<p>
  Some other  the disadvantages are:
  <ul>
    <li><b>taking big traffic resource for 
      loading</b><p>If your animation is too 
      heavy and the conditions of the 
      product use were not analyzed 
      thoughtfully, it can bring out 
      the problem of long loading and 
      annoy users instead of creating positive 
      emotions</p>
      <li><b>overloading the screen/page</b>
        <p>Even purely decorative animations 
          should have their aim, place and function 
          which is based on the general concept. 
          <em>Animation used for pure attraction and 
          not enhancing positive emotions and 
          efficient interaction risks losing lots of 
          users who will find the way to their problem 
            solution overloaded with unnecessary details.</em>
<p>Moreover, the screen which is overloaded with animated items 
          decreases their potential. To make the analogy, 
          you can like one song very much, but if you 
          here it everywhere thousand times per day
          you can end up hating it just because you are 
          fed up with it. Animation brings the same thing:
          when it is and interesting and engaging detail it 
          will work successfully to help user and will look 
          attractive in contrast with static elements. But if 
  you make everything on your page move, 
  users will get tired very quickly. 
  You can feel the power and joy of 
  motion only if you have a chance to 
  stop when needed.
  <li><p><b>distraction</b>
In case of user interface design,
    even any smallest piece of animation 
    should correspond to the aim of the
    page or screen. So, first of all 
    UI/UX designer should research and 
    think over the functions and aims 
    of the screen or page as well as 
    abilities and wishes of target 
    audience which will interact with 
    them. <em>If animation doesn’t solve 
    any problem, doesn’t enhance 
    positive experience and doesn’t 
    support user, it would be better 
    to omit it in order to create 
    the performance of the product 
    only with essential details not 
    overloading the general process.</em>

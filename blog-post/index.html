        WHEN CAN ANIMATIONS HURT USER EXPERIENCE?

          Normally animations are charming and very engaging, 
          but sometimes, when they are bad designed and don't have 
          any purpose they become into something annoying and useless.

          But what happens when, instead of having one animation, whether is well designed or not, there is many? What would you do if everything is moving at the same time on the same screen? Would you know what you have to click-on first? This situation is actually making your experience harder than it should.
          So if you are planning on creating any type of website 
          or phone application, is imperative for you to balance the kind and quantity of animations you want to add to your design with the user experience you want to offer.

    <td>  If the user has an outdated browser and you website contains a lot or heavy animations most probably the user wont be able to enter or use your site.</td>
